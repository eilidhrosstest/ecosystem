We create our content with the intention of engaging with the whole person â€“ intellect, body, and intuition - to create honest discussions. That's why we've created Rebel Wisdom Live - a regular event series designed to create a space in which we can discuss challenging ideas. For those looking to have a direct experience of the ideas in our films and 'level up' in their lives, we also run regular retreats. we believe in the rebellious, transformative power of genuine Truth.
