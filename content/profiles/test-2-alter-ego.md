Alter Ego is a powerful network of leaders who are prototyping a deeper form of change, people who know that we need to change at a psychological and cultural level to have a chance of making it through this crisis moment in history.

The organisation runs gatherings, which aim to create a spacious few days of renewal and inspiration, where attendees can expect to make some new friends and potentially form exciting work projects.

Alter Ego has been gathering new political leaders to find our way out of this crisis moment in history. Their new media series profiles the big ideas that are emerging from the pioneering edge of the political conversation. Itâ€™s a beautiful network of leaders who are prototyping a deeper form of change, people who know that we need to change at a psychological and cultural level to have a chance of making it through this crisis moment in history.
